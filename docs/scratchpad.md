# üìù Scratchpad - Emoji Sticker Book

*This document is for free-form notes, lessons learned, development logs, and temporary information.*

## Current Development Notes

### Initial Assessment (Phase 1 Planning)
**Date**: Current Planning Session  
**Status**: Transitioning from prototype to enterprise-grade development

#### What's Working Well
- Basic Compose UI structure is solid foundation
- Core sticker functionality is intuitive and responsive
- Page navigation feels natural with HorizontalPager
- Emoji categorization provides good user experience
- Build system and signing process is properly configured

#### Technical Debt Identified
- State management is ad-hoc, needs architectural refactor
- No comprehensive testing framework
- Performance not optimized for older devices
- Accessibility features incomplete
- Error handling is minimal

#### Key Findings from Code Review
- Package naming inconsistency: `com.example.storybookemoji` vs `io.github.storybookemoji`
- Mixed mutable/immutable state patterns causing recomposition issues
- Direct manipulation of MutableList in PageData breaking state immutability
- No separation between business logic and UI code

## Development Lessons

### Lesson 1: State Management Complexity
**Context**: Current BookScreen manages all state directly  
**Issue**: Direct mutation of page state causing inconsistent UI updates  
**Learning**: Need proper state management with immutable data structures  
**Action**: Implement BookState pattern with proper Compose state handling

### Lesson 2: Testing Strategy
**Context**: Only example tests exist currently  
**Issue**: No way to verify functionality during refactoring  
**Learning**: Testing framework must be established before major changes  
**Action**: Set up comprehensive test suite as Phase 1 priority

### Lesson 3: Performance Considerations
**Context**: App currently works on modern devices  
**Issue**: Target includes older devices (API 21+)  
**Learning**: Performance optimization cannot be afterthought  
**Action**: Include performance testing in every development cycle

## Quick Notes & Reminders

### Development Environment
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer required
- Kotlin 1.9+ for latest language features
- Compose BOM 2024.02+ for stable APIs
- Minimum API 21 for 95% device coverage

### Package Name Issue
**CRITICAL**: Inconsistent package naming between build files and source code
- Build files use: `com.example.storybookemoji`
- Source code uses: `io.github.storybookemoji`
- **Resolution needed**: Standardize on `io.github.storybookemoji` throughout

### Performance Targets
- 60fps animations on all supported devices
- <100MB memory usage at peak
- <8MB APK size for quick downloads
- <2 second launch time

### Security Checklist
- [ ] No network permissions in manifest
- [ ] No external storage access
- [ ] No analytics or tracking code
- [ ] No third-party SDKs that phone home
- [ ] ProGuard enabled for release builds

## Architecture Decisions Log

### Decision 1: State Management Approach
**Date**: Planning Phase  
**Decision**: Move from direct state mutation to immutable state with proper Compose patterns  
**Rationale**: Current approach causes recomposition issues and unpredictable behavior  
**Alternatives Considered**: Redux-style state management, MVVM with ViewModels  
**Chosen Approach**: Compose-native state management with immutable data classes

### Decision 2: Testing Strategy
**Date**: Planning Phase  
**Decision**: Comprehensive testing with 80% coverage target  
**Rationale**: Enterprise-grade quality requires thorough testing  
**Test Types**: Unit tests for models, Integration tests for user flows, UI tests for interactions

### Decision 3: Architecture Refactor Priority
**Date**: Planning Phase  
**Decision**: Complete architecture refactor before adding new features  
**Rationale**: Technical debt will compound if not addressed early  
**Impact**: Delays feature development but ensures stable foundation

## Implementation Notes

### Current Issues to Address

#### State Management Problems
```kotlin
// PROBLEM: Direct mutation breaks immutability
page.emojiStickers.add(newSticker)

// SOLUTION: Proper immutable updates
val updatedPage = page.copy(
    emojiStickers = page.emojiStickers + newSticker
)
```

#### Performance Bottlenecks
- Multiple recompositions during drag operations
- No lazy loading for pages beyond visible range
- Expensive emoji rendering without optimization

#### Missing Error Boundaries
- No handling for touch events outside valid areas
- No recovery from memory pressure situations
- No graceful degradation for accessibility features

## Future Feature Ideas

### Drawing System
- Finger drawing with pressure sensitivity
- Multiple brush types and sizes
- Color mixing and palette management
- Undo/redo with memory-efficient implementation

### Advanced Sticker Features
- Sticker grouping and templates
- Color filters and effects
- Animation and movement trails
- Custom sticker creation from drawings

### Export Capabilities
- PDF book generation
- High-resolution image export
- Print-ready formatting
- Local sharing without cloud

## Technical Research Notes

### Compose Performance Best Practices
- Use `remember` for expensive calculations
- Implement `derivedStateOf` for computed properties
- Minimize recomposition scope with proper state lifting
- Use `LaunchedEffect` for side effects

### Accessibility Requirements
- TalkBack support for all interactive elements
- Large text scaling support
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Motor accessibility considerations

### Memory Management
- Object pooling for frequently created instances
- Proper cleanup of composable resources
- Lazy loading strategies for large data sets
- Garbage collection optimization

## Daily Development Log

### Planning Session - [Current Date]
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive project documentation structure
- ‚úÖ Analyzed existing codebase and identified technical debt
- ‚úÖ Defined clear project phases and success criteria
- ‚úÖ Established testing and quality standards

### Next Actions
1. Resolve package naming inconsistency
2. Set up testing framework infrastructure
3. Begin architectural refactoring with state management
4. Implement proper error boundaries
5. Add performance monitoring

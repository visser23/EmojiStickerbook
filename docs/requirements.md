# ðŸ“‹ Requirements - Emoji Sticker Book

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PERFORMANCE & USABILITY ISSUES (DISCOVERED IN TESTING)

### ISSUE 1: Initial Emoji Sticker Size Too Small
**Problem**: Current 80dp initial size makes drag, resize, and rotate controls difficult to test and use effectively, even for smaller fingers
**Impact**: Core functionality unusable on physical devices
**Research Findings**: 
- Current: 80dp base Ã— 1.6f display multiplier = ~128dp touch targets
- Android Guidelines: Minimum 44-48dp (7-10mm physical size)
- User Testing: 80dp base size still feels too small for precise manipulation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Initial sticker size increased to provide 48dp+ minimum touch targets
- [ ] Research-based sizing considering average phone screen sizes and finger sizes
- [ ] Minimum size prevents stickers from becoming too small to manipulate (44dp minimum)
- [ ] Maximum size prevents stickers from exceeding page boundaries
- [ ] Touch target optimization for precise gesture recognition

### ISSUE 2: Janky Gesture Handling
**Problem**: Resizing and rotation feel inconsistent and unresponsive in both emulator and physical device testing
**Impact**: Poor user experience, frustrated interactions
**Technical Findings**:
- Multiple overlapping `pointerInput` modifiers may conflict
- Complex coordinate transformations causing gesture delays
- Edge detection logic interfering with gesture recognition
- Performance optimizations potentially causing gesture conflicts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Smooth, responsive gesture handling at 60fps minimum
- [ ] Simplified gesture coordination architecture
- [ ] Eliminated gesture conflicts between drag, scale, and rotation
- [ ] Improved multi-touch handling for simultaneous gestures
- [ ] Consistent gesture responsiveness across different device types

### ISSUE 3: Non-Functional Long Press Deletion
**Problem**: Long press to delete feature isn't working, and questionable if this is the most intuitive deletion method
**Impact**: Users cannot remove stickers, core functionality broken
**UX Research Findings**:
- Long press deletion is hidden and less discoverable
- Swipe-to-delete or drag-to-bin patterns more intuitive
- Visual deletion methods provide better user feedback

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Fix current long press deletion implementation
- [ ] Research and implement more intuitive deletion UX pattern
- [ ] Visual feedback for deletion actions
- [ ] Clear, discoverable deletion method for target age group
- [ ] Undo functionality for accidental deletions
